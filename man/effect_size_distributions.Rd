\section{BayesB}{

Under a bayesB model, each locus has probability \emph{pi} of having no effect. Effects are otherwise drawn from a scaled t
distribution with degrees of freedom \emph{d.f} and scale \emph{scale}.
Alternatively, a fixed number of sites (\emph{sites}) can be given an effect from the same
distribution. This is equivalent to the expected number of sites when \emph{pi} = 1
- (\emph{sites}/\emph{n}), where \emph{n} is the number of loci.
}

\section{BayesA}{

Under a bayesA model, all loci have effects drawn from a scaled t distribution
with degrees of freedom \emph{d.f} and scale \emph{scale}. This is equivalent
to a bayesB model where \emph{pi} is equal to 0.
}

\section{scaled normal}{

Effects are drawn from a normal distribution where var(g) == 0.
Each locus has probability \emph{pi} of having no effect. Effects are otherwise drawn from a normal
distribution with mean 0, standard deviation \emph{sd}, and scale \emph{scale}.
Alternatively, a fixed number of sites (\emph{sites}) can be given an effect from the same
distribution. This is equivalent to the expected number of sites when \emph{pi} = 1
- (\emph{sites}/\emph{n}), where \emph{n} is the number of loci.
}

\section{flat}{

Each locus has probability \emph{pi} of having no effect. Effects are otherwise equal to
the parameter scale \emph{scale}.
Alternatively, a fixed number of sites (\emph{sites}) can be given an effect from the same
distribution. This is equivalent to the expected number of sites when \emph{pi} = 1
- (\emph{sites}/\emph{n}), where \emph{n} is the number of loci.
